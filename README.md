**Project team:**

Raymond Chau, Hayley Win, Tuflikha Putri and Anita Rynkanen

**Data source:**

* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mysarahmadbhat/lung-cancer)


**Project Description:**

Aim of this project was to build a web application that predicts possible occurence of lung cancer using a machine learning model.

**Development process:**

To gauge if the dataset was suitable, Plotly was used for initial exploration and visualisation. Data was modify and encoded using Jupyter Notebook. As the dataset was noted to be imbalanced SMOTE was used for oversampling the dataset. After confirming that the balance of positive and negative classes is 50/50 the dataset was split into training and testing sets and  a logistic regression model was created. ScikitLearn was used for the Machine Learning process. 

Model was deployed using Flask API. HTML, CSS and Bootstrap were used to create a website where users can enter preferred options and display the prediction. Application was deployed using Heroku.
